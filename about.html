	<h2>About</h2>
    <p>Each year, the governor and the Illinois General Assembly are constitutionally required to pass a budget for the state. Last year, they failed to do that, and we still don’t have a budget.</p>

    <p>Leading up to the budget deadline on July 1st, 2015, Republican Gov. <a href="https://www.illinoispolicy.org/rauners-budget-a-line-item-breakdown/">Rauner</a>
      and the Democratically-controlled legislature, led by House Speaker <a href="http://wgntv.com/2015/05/26/il-democrats-proposing-budget-with-3-billion-worth-of-debt/">Madigan</a> and Senate President Cullerton, presented their own wildly different budget proposals.</p>
    <p>The debate is over Gov. Rauner’s <a href="https://www.illinois.gov/gov/Documents/CompiledPacket.pdf">Turnaround Agenda</a> which, among other things, proposes stripping collective bargaining rights from unions, 
      which Democrats oppose. As a result, neither side has come to an agreement over the state budget, and both continue to blame each other for the <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/10/07/rauner-madigan-trade-blame-over-damage-from-budget-impasse/">deadlock.</a>
    <p>Now, months later, the impasse remains with no end in sight.</p>
